Assumptions:
In conventional herbicide treatment: 100% of the RR plants survive, but 1% of the SS plants survive
In low herbicide treatment: 50% of the RR plants survive and 50% of the SS plants survive
When no herbicide was applied: 50% of the RR plants survive and 50% of the SS plants survive

$$
R_n = R_0 * (1 - \frac{F\alpha}{b})^n
$$
where,  

n is the number of generation that the population is under selection pressure,  
$R_n$ is the fraction of resistant seeds after n generations,  
$R_o$ is the initial frequency of resistant seeds,  
F is the fecundity of surviving plants
$\alpha$ is the ratio of resistant versus susceptible plants that survived after a generation of exposure  
b is the number of years that a seed remains viable in the soil seedbank
