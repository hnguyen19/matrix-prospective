+ To turn 18 equations for fecundity estimation from aboveground dried biomass (in AMATA-fecundity) to 18 matrices: 
- First round: all cohorts within the same crop identity crossed with corn weed management are subject to the same seed production potential, which means using one prediction equation for all cohorts.  

- Second round: Each cohort within he same crop identity crossed with corn weed management need its own prediction equation for fecundity.  This effort requires partitioning the cohort by plant size. Partitioning can be done coarsely by grouping 2019 plant size and fecundity, then apply the same classifying rule on 2018 plant size.
