+ Turn 18 equations for fecundity estimation from aboveground dried biomass (in AMATA-fecundity) to 18 matrices: 
- Each cohort within he same crop identity crossed with corn weed management need its own prediction equation for fecundity. The whole  

This effort requires partitioning the cohort by plant size. Partitioning can be done coarsely by grouping 2019 plant size and fecundity, then apply the same classifying rule on 2018 plant size.  

+ To apply the 18 fecundity equations in AMATA-fecundity on 2019 female biomass.

FLOW-recruitment-matrix-organization.Rmd: 
+ Seed fates summary as a reference point: annual progression of waterhemp seedbank densities from 2014 through 2019. Another version that summarize the whole seedbank progression and waterhemp only is available in ../Dissertation/AMATA-demography.

+ Translate 2020 emergence density into germinated proportion of the 2019 seedbank.  

FLOW-literature-based-matrices.Rmd: 
+ Organize fresh seed viability to matrices (As of Mar 2022: not included in the model yet, because only plumped seeds were counted)

+ Organize Sosnoskie et al., 2013 seed survival equations into in-season and off-season survival. The in-season seed survival was combined with plant cohort survival, the off-season survival was stand-alone.
