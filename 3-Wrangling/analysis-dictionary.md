## Current questions: 


How did changes in {emergence timing, seedling density, mature density, fecundity, overwinter survival, and tillage regime} affect population size? 

At model year 1: Assuming a certain resistant profile, cumulatively from all mode-of-action, how did delayed emergence affect resistance development? Can the HR population be diluted?

Refine: How did each MOA resistance contribute to the overall resistance?
