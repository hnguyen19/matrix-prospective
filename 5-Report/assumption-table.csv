All,Sex is stable throughout the life cycle.,"Montgomery et al., 2019; 2021"
,Equal growth rate across individuals of the same size and shape under the same treatments (crop x rotation x herbicide),"Chapter 8, Caswell, 2001"
Seed,Equal germination probability across sexes,No evidence of sexually differentiated seed germination probability
,The sex ratio is 1:1.,"Costea et al., 2005"
,Sex is determined at seed formation,"Montgomery et al., 2019; 2021"
,Seeds only emerge from the 0-2cm soil stratum,"Deduced collectively from the recommended sowing depth of 1-3 times the seed diameter (Chapter 3, FAO 1989) and AMATA seed size of 1 mm or less in diameter (Costea et al., 2005)."
,Germination is fatal from the 2-20 cm soil stratum,"Deduced collectively from the recommended sowing depth of 1-3 times the seed diameter (Chapter 3, FAO 1989) and AMATA seed size of 1 mm or less in diameter (Costea et al., 2005)."
,Equal decay rate in the soil across sexes,No evidence of sexually differentiated seed decay rates
,Equal decay rate across all burial depths,"Buhler et al., 2001 and  Steckel et al., 2007"
,Equal palatability to granivores across sexes,No evidence of sexually differentiated palatability
,Granivore activities are an important threat.,"van der Laat et al., 2015"
Young plant,Female plants are more likely to survive under stressful conditions than male plants.,"Deduced collectively from the general 1:1 sex ratio (Costea et al., 2005) and differentiated sex ratio at maturity across weed management systems at the experiment site in 2018."
,Crops are the main competitors for resources.,"Nutrient run-off is a persistent problem in industrial agriculture, meaning the available nutrient exceeds all plants, including weeds' needs"
,Competition with other weeds is negligible.,"Waterhemp is one of the most competive weed species in row crop environments (Johnson et al., 2009 and Prince et al., 2012)"
,Intraspecific competition is negligible.,"Deduct collective from 1) nutrient run-off is a persistent problem in industrial agriculture, meaning the available nutrient exceeds all plants, including weeds' needs and 2) weed control measures application often occur at waterhemp's very young stage, leaving very few seedling survived"
,The weed control program catered to the specific crop is the main cause of mortality.,"Ryan et al., 2010"
Mature plant,Pollen source is affluently available to all female plants at reproduction stage,"Pollens can stay viable for five days after dispersion (Liu et al., 2012) and substantial population density and sex ratio at the experiment site (Nguyen and Liebman, 2022a)"
,50% of the seeds produced by each female plant are female.,"Costea et al., 2005"
,Male : female ratio can deviate from 1:1 ratio under different conditions,"Nguyen and Liebman, 2022b and Montgomery et al., 2019 and 2021"
