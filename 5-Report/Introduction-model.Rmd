*overview*  

Common waterhemp (*Amaranthus tuberculatus* (Moq.) J.D. Sauer) is an agronomically challenging weed species whose soil seedbank can be *rapidly replenished under favorable conditions*, so multiple tactics are required to effectively limit the number of seeds entering the soil seedbank [@davisWeedSeedPools2008]. 

Following the population in full life cycles using Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) in different crop environments help identifies the choke points where management could be focused [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001]. 

For waterhemp management, seed shattering reduction, removal of seeds on the soil surface, and customization of tillage systems are all important because the persistence of waterhemp seedbank is highly dependent on the local crop management techniques [@bagavathiannanPostdispersalLossImportant2013; @korresSeedbankPersistencePalmer2018; @menalledEffectsCompostedSwine2005]. 


A heuristic model for common waterhemp population dynamics in corn (*Zea mays* L.) and soybean (*Glycine max* (L.) Merr.) with or without rye (*Secale cereale* L.) cover crop in between corn and soybean phases concluded that rye cover crop could provide minimal suppression against common waterhemp abundance.
Prospective analysis using a population matrix approach can be used to examine how a population would change over a period given the input parameters, but without extensive field trials [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001; @davisCroppingSystemEffects2002; @ullrichWeedPopulationDynamics2000].



*waterhemp in different models and information gaps*  
Interseeding red clover with wheat followed by spring tillage delayed and reduced seedling emergence as compared with three other interseeding and tillage timing combinations by fall tillage [@davisCroppingSystemEffects2003]. Our exhaustive search of the current literature does not return any information on waterhemp's population dynamics in other crops. 


*importance of the present study*

Seedbank persistence is often influenced by multiple factors, such as burial depth, tillage regime, and crop environment  [@steckelTillageCroppingSystem2007]. Determining the most influential factors on changes in population dynamics could be useful in targeting efforts to accelerate seedbank depletion. 

This study was pursued to examine how waterhemp population might changes in cool-season crops suitable for the Midwestern US climates, such as oat and red clover or oat and alfalfa intercrops, and alfalfa sole crop. The data used in this exercise were collected from empirical experiment and the literature. The waterhemp populations in this study were depth-structured for the soil seedbank and cohort-structured for plants to accommodate the variation in seed survival [@yenishEffectsTillageVertical1992; @buhlerEmergencePersistenceSeed2001] and emergence rates [@werlePredictingEmergence232014] at different depths, plant survival rates [@hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004;  @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004], plant size, and fecundity of different cohorts [@hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004; @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004]. 

A periodic matrix model [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001; @cousensDynamicsWeedPopulations1995] was used to study waterhemp population dynamics because periodic matrices accommodate the examination of the effect of various events, i.e., crop management activities, that occur throughout the life cycle of waterhemp on the population change rate.
