In arable land, a low density seedbank is highly desired. A weed species's eedbank persistence is often influenced by multiple factors, such as burial depth, tillage regime, and crop environment [@steckelTillageCroppingSystem2007]. Common waterhemp (*Amaranthus tuberculatus* (Moq.) J.D. Sauer) is an agronomically challenging weed species whose high fecundity, high relative growth rate and opportunistic emergence can help maintain an affluent seedbank [@menalledEffectsCompostedSwine2005; @davisWeedSeedPools2008; @bagavathiannanPostdispersalLossImportant2013; @korresSeedbankPersistencePalmer2018]. 

In order to increase labor use efficiency in waterhemp management, it is helpful to know possible choke points throughout waterhemp's life cycle, where intervention can substantially reduce the population growth. Following the population in full life cycles in different crop environments can help identifies the choke points where management could be focused [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001]. Combining demographic parameters from multiple sources and organized them in different scenarios can provide a quick evaluation of population responses and inform researchers on where empirical measurement efforts should be focused.   

Interseeding red clover with wheat followed by spring tillage delayed and reduced seedling emergence as compared with three other interseeding and tillage timing combinations by fall tillage [@davisCroppingSystemEffects2003]. Our exhaustive search of the current literature does not return any information on waterhemp's population dynamics in other cool-season crops so we attempted to empirically measure those. In addition, we measured how much time waterhemp emergence can be delayed in cool-season crops that can be planted overwinter or very early in spring to limit waterhemp's exposure to sunlight when come the time of its emergence.  

Extending a conventional 2-year rotation of corn and soybean (two warm-season annual crops) to contain cool-season crops (oat, red clover, and alfalfa) effectively maintain weed community at a level of abundance that did not correlate with crop yield decline [@nguyenWeedCommunityComposition2022]. The effects of cropping system diversification on common waterhemp abundance was not clearly defined [@nguyenWeedCommunityComposition2022], even though their reproductive potentials could be compromised without over-reliance on chemical herbicide [@nguyenImpactCroppingSystem2022].

A heuristic model for common waterhemp population dynamics in corn (*Zea mays* L.) and soybean (*Glycine max* (L.) Merr.) with or without rye (*Secale cereale* L.) cover crop in between corn and soybean phases concluded that rye cover crop could provide minimal suppression against common waterhemp abundance. Prospective analysis using a population matrix approach can be used to examine how a population would change over a period given the input parameters, but without extensive field trials [@ullrichWeedPopulationDynamics2000; @caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001; @davisCroppingSystemEffects2002]. In addition, retrospective perturbation analysis can be used to examine how a population would change if changes occurred at different points throughout the species' life cycle.

A periodic matrix model [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001; @cousensDynamicsWeedPopulations1995] was used to study waterhemp population dynamics because periodic matrices accommodate the examination of the effect of various events, i.e., crop management activities, that occur throughout the life cycle of waterhemp on the population change rate, $\lambda$. We used the general equation of $N_{h+1} = A N_h$ [@caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001] to study population change, $\lambda$ from one period to another. The waterhemp populations in this study were depth-structured for the soil seedbank and cohort-structured for plants to accommodate the variation in seed survival [@yenishEffectsTillageVertical1992; @buhlerEmergencePersistenceSeed2001] and emergence rates [@werlePredictingEmergence232014] at different depths, plant survival rates [@hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004; @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004], plant size, and fecundity of different cohorts [@hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004; @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004]. 

Elasticity analysis, which provides a closer look at how changes in $\lambda$, $\Delta \lambda$ would response to proportional perturbations in the lower-level demographic parameters (represents the sub-annual responses of the population to weed management practices) can help evaluating $\Delta \lambda$ to each sub-annual intervention. In addition, since elasticity analysis involves each element $a_{ij}$ of matrix $A$, it is more convenient than sensitivity analysis in identifying the contribution of each $a_{ij}$ to $\Delta \lambda$. Sensitivity analysis only reveals $\lambda$'s response to each sub-annual transition matrix, $B_h$, so whenever a $B_h$ involves more than one non-zero element, it is impossible to evaluate the individual contribution to $\Delta \lambda$. 

This study was pursued to examine how waterhemp population might changes in cool-season crops suitable for the Midwestern US climates, such as oat and red clover or oat and alfalfa intercrops, and alfalfa sole crop. The modeling exercise presented here combines demographic parameters from the literature and empirical experiment. We hypothesized that extending a conventional 2-year rotation of corn and soybean with cool-season crops can accelerate soil seedbank depletion.
