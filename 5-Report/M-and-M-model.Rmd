### Experiment design {-}  

To study how common waterhemp’s demography differs in three cropping systems suitable for the Midwestern USA, we used a factorial design with nine crop identities crossed with two weed management regimes. Crop identity was assigned to main plots and comprised the combination of crop species name and rotation system. The different weed management regimes were assigned to split plots and comprised conventional versus low herbicide regimes applied to the corn phase of each of three rotation systems The rotation systems used in this study included a 2-year (corn-soybean) rotation, a 3-year (corn - soybean - oat (Avena sativa L.)) intercropped with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) rotation, and a 4-year (corn - soybean - oat intercropped with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) - alfalfa] rotation. There were four replications of each crop identity x herbicide regime combination. Field plots were located at the Iowa State University Agricultural Engineering and Agronomy Research Farm in Boone County, Iowa, USA.

The general experiment design and diagram were provided by @nguyenImpactCroppingSystem2022, but an updated diagram (Figure \@ref(fig:diagram)) includes tillage regimes used for each treatment. Contrasting herbicide regimes were used for both corn and soybean at the experiment site from 2008 through 2020, and soybean plots were managed by conventional herbicide starting in 2017. Data were collected in each experimental unit (eu) to accommodate the different weed management programs in the corn phase of all crop rotations.


```{r diagram, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Conceptual diagram of the three rotation systems compared within the experiment. A cycle of four calendar years is shown. Tillage regimes are symbolized with arrows: light, black ahead of crop sowing for field cultivator and medium, blue and bold orange after crop harvest for chisel and moldboard plowing, respectively. Crops are color-coded and displayed for the approximate months that they were present in the field. Emergence and establishment of common waterhemp plants are illustrated with black symbols. Grey plants shown in oat or alfalfa’s first year were physically controlled by crop harvest operations. Grey plants shown in alfalfa’s second year were physically suppressed three to four times by hay harvest. Alfalfa hay was harvested when approximately 5% of the plants flowered. Red clover in O3, and A4 treatments were terminated in the winter before growing corn in the following year, so the dark green bar in the 3-year rotation represents volunteer red clover and the light green bar in the 4-year rotation represents the living alfalfa residue in the C4 treatment."}

### Data collection and analysis {-}

The current demographic information presented here is only for female waterhemp seeds and plants because: 1) waterhemp is a dioecious species with 1:1 sex ratio [@costeaBiologyInvasiveAlien2005; @montgomerySexspecificMarkersWaterhemp2019; @montgomeryMaleSpecificChromosomal2021], 2) only female individuals are bearing seeds [@costeaBiologyInvasiveAlien2005], and 3) pollen grains are abundantly available during reproduction [@liuPollenBiologyDispersal2012]. All plant characteristics were reported for each cohort and seedbank densities were reported for two soil strata: 0 - 2 cm and 2 - 20 cm.    

#### Seed densities and seed fates in the soil seedbank {-}  

Nine groups of four soil cores arranged in a 3 x 3 grid were collected in the fall of 2019 from each experimental unit (eu). Each soil core was cut into two sections, the top 2 cm and the bottom 18 cm. No deeper sampling was conducted because the tillage regimes applied at the experiment were affecting the top 0 - 20 cm of the soil. All the 0-2 cm sections in each (eu) were packed separately from all the 2-20 sections, so each eu yield two data points, one for each of the two soil strata. Seeds were separated from the soil materials and plant residues using elutriation and floatation. Clean seeds were placed on germination paper imbibed with distilled water in Petri dishes and incubated in 28/18 degree Celsius light/dark - 18/8 hour night/day for five days. Proportions of seeds that are dormant, readily germinable, and dead were recorded: germinated as readily germinable, firm and unyielding to forceps pressure as dormant; and yielding to forceps pressure as dead [@borzaComparingEstimatesSeed2007]. Readily germinable and dormant seeds were grouped as viable and used to calculate emergence proportion (Details on how the 2019 fall soil seedbank sample was used with 2020 destructive emergence record keeping for emergence proportion calculation is provided in *Parameterization*).   

#### Emergence pattern and timing {-}
 
In the 2019 field season, non-destructive emergence survey was recorded once every two to three weeks (weather permitting) in eight quadrats per eu. Seedlings were marked with color-coded toothpicks for cohort identification. Within an eu, seedlings that were in the same cohort were marked with the same toothpick color. Six cohorts of plants were followed from seedling to senescence. 

In the 2020 field season, destructive emergence survey was recorded in eight quadrats per eu. Seedlings were clipped at the base of the plant without disturbing the soil. With the intention to evaluate the proportion of seed germinated from the top 2 cm layer of the soil, eight to ten cohorts (depending on the crop environments) were recorded.  

The number of seedlings at each cohort was converted to densities (seedlings/m$^2$). The dates of first emergence detection in each crop identity were noted. 

#### Statistical analysis of the measured parameters {-}

All the response variables were analyzed with two-factorial mix-effect models, in which crop identity (crop species in each rotation) was the main-plot effect, corn weed management was the split-plot effect, and cohort identity was the covariance. The response variables were transformed as needed to correct heteroscedasticity.

### Matrix form {-}   

Each rotation transition matrix, $A_r$, is the product of two, three or four annual projection matrices, $P_c$ (c = 2, 3, or 4, corresponding to the number of crop phases in each rotation). Each set of annual projection matrices, corresponding to a crop environment, $P_c$, is the product of six sub-annual matrices, $B_h$ with $h = \{t(s), g, s, f, t(f), o\}$. The six sub-annual matrices, in chronological order from spring to winter, are pre-planting tillage induced seed vertical movement ($B_{t(s)}$), emergence ($B_g$), summer seed and seedling survival ($B_s$), fecundity ($B_f$), post-harvest tillage induced seed vertical movement ($B_{t(f)}$), and overwinter seed survival ($B_o$). 

Any transition matrix (periodic sub-annual, ($B_h$), annual, ($A_r$), or rotational, ($P_c$)), is of eight rows by eight columns (8 x 8) consists of four blocks using the format of matrix 4.8 in [Chapter 4, @caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001].  

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
  M_{s} & M_{p,s}  \\ \hline
  M_{s,p} & M_{p} 
\end{array} \right]
$$

where,  
$M_s$, 2 x 2, is the transition within the seedbank population (tillage-induced seed movement and summer and overwinter seed survival),   
$M_p$, 6 x 6, is the transition within the plant population (seedling survival to maturity),  
$M_{s,p}$, 6 x 2, is the transition from the seedbank to the plant population (emergence), and    
$M_{p,s}$, 2 x 6, is the transition from the plant to the seedbank population (distribution of newly produced seeds to the soil seedbank)  

The compilation of each $B_h$ matrix, from the published literature, empirical measurement, or both parameters are detailed in the *Parameterization* section. In total, eighteen sets of six sub-annual periodic matrices were used. Each set of sub-annual matrices was constructed for every crop identity crossed with corn weed management combination. Population transition matrices were calculated using Wood's quadratic programming method [Section 6.2, @caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001].
  

### Parameterization {-}  
Two scenarios of population dynamics presented in this manuscript were distinguished by plant fecundity (see *Plant fecundity* for details).  In scenario 1, plant cohorts were recorded. In scenario 2, plant cohorts were assigned by their size because the emergence timing of the sampled plants were not included under the assumption that plant size decreases as emergence is delayed (Table \@ref(tab:assumptions)). All the parameters were calculated for a female-only population.


The lower-level demographic parameters are demographic parameters at each sub-annual periods, $B_h$, filling $B_h$ elements at positions that describe seed and plant dynamics. From left to right, the eight columns of a $B_h$ matrix are named as `seed_top`, `seed_bottom`, `plant_cohort_1`, ..., `plant_cohort_6`. `seed_top` and `seed_bottom` represents two stratum of the soil seedbank. The same order is applied down eight rows of $B_h$.  
The examined lower-level demographic parameters can be grouped based on their impacts to preserving and producing new seeds, hereafter referred to as seed production, seed preservation, and neutral parameters. The seed preserving parameters are the probability of seeds not emerging ($d = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^6 g_k$). The seed producing parameters are the emergence probabilities ($g_k, k = \{1,...6\}$), the survival rates of seeds ($s_{sk}, k = \{1,2\}$) and seedlings ($s_{pk}, k = \{1,...,6\}$) during summer, the fecundity rate ($f_k,  k = \{1,...,6\}$), and the survival rate overwinter ($o_k, k = {1,2}$). Even though emergence reduces the seedbank, the number of seeds that are produced from an emerged seedling that succeeds until seed production are substantial, so emergence is considered positively impacting new seed production [@davisWeedSeedPools2008]. The neutral parameters to both seed preservation and seed production are tillage-induced seed movement across soil strata at the pre-planting ($t_{ij,s}, i,j = \{1,2\}$) and post-harvest $t_{ij,f}, i,j = \{1,2\}$) periods. The tillage-induced seed vertical movement rates are considered neutral parameters because the seeds that are kept at or moved to the 0-2 cm soil layer can be exposed to emergence stimulants or granivores while the seeds that are kept at or moved to the 2-20 cm soil layer can germinate without reaching the soil surface (fatal germination), are exposed to decaying stimuli; or preserved at optimal conditions [@burnsideSeedLongevity411996; @davisEnvironmentalFactorsAffecting2005; @davisInfluenceSeedDepth2007].

#### Published literature data {-}

##### Pre-planting tillage induced vertical redistribution of seeds {-}  

The only non-zeroes section of the pre-planting tillage induced vertical redistribution of seeds is $M_s$. $M_s$'s were resized from the raw data of Seed Chaser [@spokasSeedChaserVerticalSoil2007], a simulation program that estimate vertical seed movement after tillage: the proportion of seeds staying at its original soil stratum, $t_{11,s}$ and $t_{22,s}$, or move to another stratum, $t_{12,s}$ and $t_{21,s}$. The original matrices in @spokasSeedChaserVerticalSoil2007 were resized to 2 x 2 by summing over all the elements within each of the four sections, i.e., top left 2 x 2, bottom left 18 x 2, top right 2 x 18, and 18x18, and divide each of the i x 2 summations by the summation of the 20 x 2 left section, and each of the i x 18 summations by the summation of the 20 x 2 right section.  

No-till is represented by an identical matrix, $I$, after @cousensModelEffectsCultivation1990. A field cultivator was applied before planting corn (C2, C3, and C4), soybean (S2, S3, and S4), and oat (O3 and O4). No tillage was applied before alfalfa (A4) because alfalfa that was intercropped with oat in the 4-year rotation (O4) was kept overwinter and grown as a sole crop in the following year.     


$$
B_{t(s)} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
t_{11,s} & t_{21,s} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
t_{12,s} & t_{22,s} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\hline    
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... &0\\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$   




##### In-season survival of seeds and seedlings {-}

The matrix $B_s$ is comprised of seed survival rates at the $M_s$ and plant survival rates at the $M_p$ sections, respectively.  


$$
B_s = \left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
s_{s_1}  & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
0 & s_{s_2}  & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\hline             
0 & 0 & s_{p_1} & ... & ... & ...&...  & 0\\
... & ... & 0 & s_{p_2} & ... & ... & ... & 0\\ 
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ...& 0 & s_{p_6}\\
\end{array}\right]
$$ 

The $M_s$ section's diagonal ($s_{s_1}$ and $s_{s_2}$) were filled with survival rates adapted from equations $o_1 = y = 98.9 e^{-0.068x} \%$ and $o_2 = y = 99.5 e^{-0.05x} \%$ [Figures 1 and 3, @sosnoskieGlyphosateResistanceDoes2013] for the top and bottom layers. The values of x, denoted as $x_s$, the burial length since emergence until new seed production, were assigned at 6 for corn and soybean, *6.5 for oat, and 7 for alfalfa* crop environments (Table \@ref(tab:Julian-19-20-tab)).  


The empirically measured data for seedling survival was deemed unrealistically (Appendix) low as compared to the literature, so @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004's results were used for corn and @hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004's results were used for soybean crop environments. The seedling survival rates by cohort ($s_{p_k}, k = \{1,...,6\}$) were assigned such that the earlier cohorts had lower survival rate in the oat crop environment; and those in the alfalfa crop environment were evenly low in all cohorts. These estimated numbers were based on a suggestion that cool-season crop environments can inhibit warm-season weed species growth [@nguyenWeedCommunityComposition2022 and citations given there].

##### Plant fecundity {-}  

The plant fecundity matrix ($B_f$) had the $M_s$ block's diagonal filled with 1's and the first row of the $M_{p,s}$ filled with $f_k, k =\{1,...,6\}$. The 1's in the $M_s$ block's diagonal are placeholders to carry the product from the previous matrices over.  

$$
\mathbf{B_f} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
1 & 0 & f_1 & f_2 & ... & ... & ... & f_6\\
0 & 1 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\hline   
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
... & ...& ... & ... &...&...&...& 0\\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & 0 & 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$   



Two scenarios of plant fecundity were used. In scenario 1, plant fecundity ($f_k, k =\{1,...,6\}$) in each crop identity crossed with corn weed management was estimated from plant aboveground mass using eighteen equations from @nguyenImpactCroppingSystem2022. In scenario 2, the plants were partitioned into six size-based bins and their fecundity was summarized as $f_k, k =\{1,...,6\}$ and filled in their relevant positions in the $B_f$ matrix by partitioning. Both practices in scenarios 1 and 2 were based on the assumption that plant size and fecundity decreased as emergence delayed [@hartzlerEffectCommonWaterhemp2004; @nordbyInfluenceCornCommon2004].   

##### Post-harvest tillage induced vertical redistribution of seeds post-harvest tillage {-}

The compilation of $B_{t(f)}$ was the similar to that of $B_{t(s)}$. Chisel plowing was applied after corn was harvested in the C2, C3, and C4 treatments, no-till was applied after harvests in the  S2, S3, S4, and O4 treatments, and moldboard was applied at the end of the O3 and A4 phases.  

$$
B_{t(f)} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
t_{11,f} & t_{21,f} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
t_{12,f} & t_{22,f} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\hline    
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$   

##### Overwinter survival {-} 

The compilation of matrix $B_o$ was similar to that of $B_\sigma$, using equations $o_1 = y = 98.9 e^{-0.068x} \%$ and $o_2 = y = 99.5 e^{-0.05x} \%$ [Figures 1 and 3, @sosnoskieGlyphosateResistanceDoes2013]. $o_{ij}$ was calculated with different values of x, denoted as $x_w$ the burial length after post-harvest tillage application until emergence initiation, were assigned at 6 for corn and soybean, *5.5 for oat, and 5 for alfalfa* crop environments (Table \@ref(tab:Julian-19-20-tab)), equivalent to $12 - x_s$ in the summer seed survival in matrix $B_{\sigma}$.

$$
\mathbf{B_o} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
o_{11} & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
0  & o_{22} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\hline    
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0 \\
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$   


#### Empirically measured data {-}

##### Seedling recruitment {-}  

The emergence proportions calculated from step 5 here are positioned on the first column of block $M_{s,p}$ in matrix $B_g$. $1 - sum_{k=1}^6 g_k$ represents the non-emerging seeds proportion.  

$$
\mathbf{B_g}=\left[\begin{array}
{rr|rrrrr} 
d = 1-\sum_{k=1}^6 g_k & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\  
0 & 1 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\  
\hline             
g_1 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\  
... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ... & ...\\  
g_6 & 0 & 0 & ... & ... & ... & ... & 0\\  
\end{array}\right]
$$   


The proportion of seedling emergence from the top 0-2 cm soil seedbank stratum in each crop identity crossed with corn weed management was calculated with the following steps:   

1 - Estimate the 0-2 cm and 2-20 cm seedbank densities with the soil seedbank samples collected before post-harvest tillage. A seed column at a particular sub-annual period is comprised of the 0-2 cm and 2-20 cm soil stratum seed densities, $N_h = [s_t, s_b]$.  

From steps 2 through 4, the seed column in sub-period h, $N_h$, was transitioned from one period to the next with the general matrix multiplication of $N_{h+1} = B_hN_h$ by @caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001.  

2 - Estimate post-harvest tillage induced seed vertical redistribution with resized Seed Chaser [@spokasSeedChaserVerticalSoil2007] chisel and moldboard plowing matrices, as detailed in the *Post-harvest tillage induced seed vertical movement*, to yield $N_{t(f)}$       

3 - Adapt overwinter survival rates as previously explain in he *Overwinter survival section* and apply it on $N_{t(f)}$ to yield $N_o$. Corn weed management did not affect waterhemp's first cohort emergence in the same crop environment (Appendix), so the same value of $x_s$ was used for the same crop identity.    

4 - Estimate pre-planting tillage induced seed vertical redistribution with resized Seed Chaser [@spokasSeedChaserVerticalSoil2007] field cultivator matrix, similar to step 2 to yield $N_{t(s)}$.   

5 - Divide the seedling density in each cohort, $l_k$, by $s_{11,f}$, the top soil stratum seed density to yield $g_k$.   


### Variance of the lower-level parameters {-}
The variance-covariance matrix of each matrix $B_h$, $V_h$, was used to calculate the variance of $\lambda$. $V_h$ dimension depended on the dimension of the non-zero block in the relevant $B_h$ matrix. All the $V_h$ matrices, but $V_\tau$ and  $V_\gamma$, are diagonal. Variance of zero is assumed to be zero. 

#### Pre-planting and post-harvest tillage induced seed movement {-}

The variance-covariance matrix of matrices $B_{t(s)}$ and $B_{t(f)}$ are 2 x 2 because these periods involved seed dynamics only. $v_{t_{i,j}} = \frac{t_i (1-\tau_i)}{n_.j}$ and $\rho_{t_{i,j}} = -\frac{t_i t_j}{n_.j}$, where $n_.j$ is the column summation of all the seeds in the relevant $B_t$ matrix.  

$$
V_{t(s)} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr} 
v_{t_{11,s}} & \rho_{t_{21,s}} \\
\rho_{t_{12,s}} & v_{t_{22,s}} \\
\end{array}\right]
$$  

and    

$$
V_{t(f)} = \left[\begin{array}
{rr} 
v_{t_{11,f}} & \rho_{t_{21,f}} \\
\rho_{t_{12,f}} & v_{t_{22,f}} \\
\end{array}\right]
$$   


#### Seedling emergence {-}

The diagonals of $V_g$ were filled with $\frac{pi(1-p_i)}{n}$ and other elements, where $i \neq j$, were filled with $\frac{-p_ip_j}{n}$. $p_k$ is the proportion of seedling emerge at cohort k. The off-diagonal of the $M_s$ and the second column of the $M_{s,p}$ are zeros because we assumed no emergence from the 2-20 cm soil stratum and that the seedling emergence from the 0-2 cm soil stratum is independent of the 2-20 stratum soil seedbank density, and $n$ is the number of seeds in the 0-2 cm soil stratum. 

$$

#### Summer seedling and plant survival {-}

$v_{s_{s_1}}$ and $v_{s_{s_2}}$ elements were visually estimated from Figures 1 and 3, in @sosnoskieGlyphosateResistanceDoes2013 because the raw data was not available. All other elements are 0 because we assumed seed survival in different strata and plant survival in different cohorts are independent of one another.  

$$

$$ 

#### Plant fecundity {-}

The variance-covariance matrix of $B_f$, $V_f$, is 6 x 6 because this period involved plant dynamics only. $v_{f_k} = \frac{\sum_{m=1}^z (m_{z} - \bar{m_k})} {n_k - 1}$, where $f_z$ is the fecundity of plant z in cohort k, $\bar{f_k}$ is the mean fecundity of the cohort k, and $n_k$ is the number of plants in cohort k. Variance of a cohort that had only one sample was assigned zero. Fecundity of plants in different cohorts were assumed independent, so $\rho(f_i,f_j) = 0$.  

$$
\mathbf{V_f} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrrrr} 
v_{f_1} & 0 & ... & ... & ... & 0 & \\
... & ...& ... & ... &...&...\\
... & ... & ... & ... & v_{f_5} & ... \\ 
0 & ... & ... & ... & 0 & v_{f_6} \\
\end{array}\right]
$$   

#### Overwinter survival {-}

Similar to $V_s$, the variance-covariance matrix of $B_o$, $V_o$, is 2x2 because this stage involved seed dynamics only. The $v_o_{11}$ and $v_{o_{22}$ elements were visually estimated from Figures 1 and 3, in @sosnoskieGlyphosateResistanceDoes2013 because the raw data was not available. Survival rates of seeds in different strata were assumed independent, so $\rho(f_i,f_j) = 0$

$$
V_o = \left[\begin{array}
{rr} 
v_{o_{11}} & 0 \\
0  & v_{o_{22}} \\
\end{array}\right]
$$   

### Modeling {-}

 

Within a year, waterhemp population projection from time $k$ to $k+1$ was reflected by the changes in number of seeds and plants and calculated as follow [Chapters 2, 3 and 4, @caswellMatrixPopulationModels2001].  
$$N_{h+1} = B_h*N_h$$  
where,  
$B_h$ is the square transition matrix from time $h$ to time $h+1$, and   
$N$ is the population vector (in column matrix form) of eight rows and one column.  
Waterhemp population transition in one crop phase, from pre-planting tillage to winter seed dormancy is calculated with 

$$ N_{r_{c,h+1}} = N_{r_{c,w}}*\prod_{h=1}^H B_h  \;\;\;\;\;  [1]$$   
where,   
$r_{c}$ is the index for the $c^{th}$ crop phase in a particular rotation,   
$N_{r_{c}}$ is the Leslie population matrix in crop phase $c^{th}$ corn weed management $w^{th}$, and   [@leslieUseMatricesCertain1945]   
$B_h$ is the population transition matrix during summer    

The main factors that contribute to the success of the control practices used for waterhemp are tillage regime, herbicides, cultivation practice, and crops' competitiveness. Among those four factors, crop competitiveness is reflected in emergence proportion, mature plant size (intermediate value to calculate fecundity), and fecundity because this factor could not be measured independently.  



Matrix calculation in this study was performed in R version 4.2.0 [@rdevelopmentcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2022]. The population growth rate ($\lambda$) sensitivity and elasticity were calculated with `eigen.analysis` function in the `popbio` package version 2.7 [@stubbenPopbioConstructionAnalyse2020].  

#### Sensitivity of population growth rate on each lower-level parameter {-}

In all the Life Table Retrospective Experiment (LTRE) procedures performed here, the conventional corn weed management treatment is the reference treatment and low herbicide regime is the treatment of interest, following @caswellSensitivityAnalysisPeriodic1994's notions.

The sensitivities of $\lambda$ to changes in sub-annual demographic parameters are not presented in this manuscript, but $S_{B_h}$ were used as intermediate parameters to calculate the elasticity of $\lambda$ to each element of a sub-annual projection matrix *and variance of $\lambda$*. The sensitivity of $\lambda$ to each element of each sub-annual periodic matrix is calculated with

$$
S_{B_h} = {(B_{(h-1)}...B_{(1)}...B_{(h+1)})}^TS_{A(h)} = D^T S_{A(h)} \,\,\,(2)
$$ 

where,
$B_h$ is the periodic projection matrix for sub-annual period h; $h = \{1,...,6\}$,
$D^T$ is the transpose of the matrix product of all the $B_h$, and
$S_{A(h)}$ is the sensitivity of $\lambda$ to each element of $A^*_h$ (the average annual projection matrix between the reference treatment and the treatment of interest).  

In general, each $S_{B_h}$, except for $S_{B_g}$ - sensitivity of $\lambda$ to summer survival, is a 8 x 2 matrix. In all $S_{B_h}$, only the first column was used in calculating the variance of population growth rate because the first column contains sensitivity values that concerns the population dynamics from changes in eight categories of interest, namely, seed density at the 0-2 cm soil stratum, seed density at the 2-20 cm soil stratum, and plant cohort one through six. The second through eighth columns are irrelevant under this manuscript's scope because those columns explain theoretical changes to $\lambda$ if other patterns occurred in the population dynamics, such as if seeds from the 2-20 cm emerged and contributed (column two), or if plant cohort one "becomes" cohort two (column three), and so on.  

#### Population growth rate and its variance {-}  

The variance of population growth rate in each rotation was calculated with $Var(\lambda) = \sum_i^b S_b^TV_bS_b$ where $V_h$ is the variance-covariance matrix of each $B_h$ matrix. The variance of annualized population growth rates ($Var(\lambda_2)$, $Var(\lambda_3)$, and $Var(\lambda_4)$) were calculated with Taylor series expansion using the general formula: $Var[f(\lambda)] = {f'(E(\lambda))}^2 Var(\lambda)$, in which $f(\lambda)$ is the nth-root function used to annualize the rotation-wise growth rates. For example, the variance of annualized population growth rate in the 2-year rotation was $Var(\lambda_{2}) = \frac{1}{4\lambda_{2r}}Var(\lambda_{2r})$, where $\lambda_2 = \sqrt{\lambda_{2r}}$.  


### Elasticity of population growth rate on each lower-level parameter {-}

The elasticity of $\lambda$ to each element of a sub-annual projection matrix is calculated with
$$
E_{B(h)} = \frac{b_{ijh}}{\lambda} S_{B(h)} \,\,\,(2)
$$ 

where,

$b_{ijh}$ is the entry at row i column j of matrix $B_h$, and other elements as defined in Equation (2).
